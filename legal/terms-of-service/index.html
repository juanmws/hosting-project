We always strive to make this a seamless process and try to avoid any interruption to existing sites/servers but in some cases we may be unable to assist you in a transfer of data from the old server. We are not responsible for data loss in transfers.

<b>Acceptable Use/Illegal Activity</b>

<h4>
	<hr>
<b>Termination of Use</b>
</h4>
<p>
  You agree that we may, at our sole discretion, suspend or terminate your access to all or part of our website and products with or without notice and for any reason, including, without limitation, breach of this User Agreement. Any suspected illegal, fraudulent or abusive activity may be grounds for terminating your relationship and may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Upon suspension or termination, your right to use the Resources we provide will immediately cease, and we reserve the right to remove or delete any information that you may have on file with us, including any account or login information. If your server is suspended for illegal activity or not paid for by the end user, OptimalNode has the right to the files on that related service.
</p>
<h4>
	<hr>
<b>Payment Information</b>
</h4>
<p>
Upon creating an account with OptimalNode you agree to make all appropriate payments for the services received, in advance of the time period during duration in which such services are provided. Moreover, unless you notify OptimalNode that you would like to cancel all or any of the services rendered, all services will be billed on an ongoing basis. In addition, as a client of OptimalNode you take full responsibility to make sure that our payment information is always up to date and that all invoices are paid on time. If any invoice is placed into an overdue status it will result in a minimum late fee of 15% and/or potential suspension until account balance has been paid in full. Optimal Node reserves full rights of changing product prices whenever, to whatever price they want, without warning.
</p>
<h4>
	<hr>
<b>Invoices and Credit Cards</b>
</h4>
<p>
Invoices are made 15 days before the due date. Credit Cards are not stored in our databases.
</p>
<h4>
	<hr>
<b>Suspensions and Chargebacks</b>
</h4>
<p>
Defining: "you" - The customer "assets", "files" or "server" or whatever other term may be used - The service provided and add-ons and files provided along with it. By purchasing with Optimal Node , “you” give us permission to host and have control over “your” files once they are active on our network. Upon suspension, where emails are sent with payment reminders; “you” risk the permanent loss of your files/add-ons. You purchase your service for a length of time, once that period is over; accessibility is lost. Where possible- “you” must ensure that “your” files are backed up in regular intervals off-site (i.e. on “your” local host). Optimal Node  takes no liability and provides no warranties that once a server is suspended, the files will be accessible by yourself or your third-parties (or sub-users). Charge backs- At no time shall any current client or former client chargeback for any reason, if you charge back your service will be suspended or terminated. Additionally if said client wishes to restart service they will be required to pay back the amount charged back. If you charge back, we will report your bad payment activity to the Major Credit Bureaus, it may hurt your credit score. Upon suspension, server files may too be deleted at the discretion of Optimal Node ’s executives. By allowing “your” server to be suspended and/or providing (or third-parties providing) Optimal Node  with the knowledge that “you” are in breach of our Terms of Service, “you” subsequently waiver “your” rights to access “your” files/assets and “your” “service”, “assets” or “server” will no longer be accessible. Once your service is suspended, your files are kept for up to 365 consecutive business days (or less, at discretion of Optimal Node ’s executives with a minimum of period 24 hours) or until the invoice on the Client Area is shown as cancelled, whichever is shortest. The accessibility, if challenged, will be forwarded onto our Billing and/or Abuse Department and will be provided with an outcome at the latest of 48 hours after challenged. - Cases of exemption: • Where you have informed Optimal Node  in a written notice that you would like a copy of your files when your service is suspended (though Optimal Node  may decide to subsequently cancel your request at any time), you may be provided with exemption or legal immunity to the above clause.
</p>
<h4>
	<hr>
<b>Cancellations</b>
</h4>
<p>
As a customer of OptimalNode you are allowed to cancel your account at any time by reaching out to our billing department which can be found in the contact us portion of our privacy policy and/or website. Moreover, Optimal Node may terminate your access to the Site, for any reason, including but not limited to, a breach of this Agreement or without cause or notice, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with you. All provisions of this Agreement that by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability. Cancelling a product/service does not grant you a refund, it only cancels and terminates your product/service. The product "Add Funds" cannot be cancelled and refunded and is not a subscription/package, it only adds credit balance to your account. PayPal subscriptions created with us are not automatically cancelled when you submit a cancellation request. If you cancel, remember to cancel the PayPal subscription as well, we are not responsible for payments made after you cancelled a product. For Dedicated Servers, we require a seven (7) day notice of cancellation prior to the billing renewal date for the upcoming billing cycle, submitted on our client area.
</p>
<h4>
	<hr>
<b>Fair and Acceptable Usage</b>
</h4>
<p>
Acceptable usage: We have a Hard limit of 50 GB for Minecraft Hosting. We will email you with the details, and which files are too big and must be removed. If we do see a non-server related file it will be deleted without warning or refund. If a server is running 80-100% of CPU or RAM, Optimal Node  has the right to restart/stop it or suspend it, as it affects others on the node. If this issue continues and the server owner refuses to fix the issue staff reserve the right to intervene if needed, including but not limited to stopping, suspending, terminating or cancelling the server. Backup plugins are not allowed if they are backing up the entire server as it usually leads to violation of this policy.
</p>
<h4>
	<hr>
<b>Payments and Refunds</b>
</h4>
<p>
All payments are done via PayPal and Paygol. Please contact us if you want to do another form of payment. We usually only give refunds within the first 168 hours, if you did not request one within that time we will not provide you with a refund. Speak with Billing/Support to claim the refund.
</p>
<h4>
	<hr>
<b>Support</b>
</h4>
<p>
  We have multiple Support Methods such as Discord, Tickets, Live chat and Twitter. The only official Support Method for Billing and Security issues is tickets on secure.optimalnode.us
